                                    Could anything be better than writing a case study about your favourite
                                    product?! Definitely not. I am a big Java junkie. Starbucks plays a
                                    significant role not only in my life but in other people's lives also.
                                    It's a go-to destination for quality coffee and a comfortable gathering
                                    place.

                                    know a little bit about it's history and over the years progress.

                                <p>
                                    Starbucks was founded in Seattle, Washington in 1971 by three partners - Jerry
                                    Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker. The three were inspired to start a coffee
                                    business after learning about the high-quality coffee beans being produced in the
                                    city of Peet's Coffee in Berkeley, California.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The partners purchased coffee beans from Peet's Coffee and began roasting and
                                    selling them in a small store in Seattle's Pike Place Market. They named their
                                    business "Starbucks," after the first mate in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At first, Starbucks sold only whole bean coffee and did not brew coffee to drink in
                                    the store. However, the popularity of their high-quality coffee beans quickly grew,
                                    and in 1982, the company opened its first cafe in downtown Seattle. The cafe offered
                                    a variety of coffee drinks and pastries, and it quickly became a popular gathering
                                    place for locals.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Over the years, Starbucks continued to expand its menu and opened new locations
                                    throughout the United States and eventually globally. Today, Starbucks is one of the
                                    largest coffee chains in the world, with more than 32,000 stores in 83 countries.

                                <p>
                                    The Starbucks of the 21st century is quite different from the Starbucks of the 1990s
                                    in several ways. Overall, while the core of the Starbucks brand remains the same -
                                    high-quality coffee and a comfortable gathering place - the company has evolved to
                                    meet the changing needs and preferences of its customers in the 21st century. Here
                                    are a few key differences:
                                </p>
                                <ul style="color: white; font-size: 16px;">
                                    <li>
                                        Store Design: In the 90s, Starbucks stores had a rustic, coffeehouse vibe, with
                                        lots of natural wood and subdued lighting. Today, Starbucks stores are more
                                        modern and sleek, with bright lighting, digital menu boards, and comfortable
                                        seating areas designed for socializing and working.

                                    <li>
                                        Menu Offerings: In the 90s, Starbucks offered a limited menu of coffee beverages
                                        and pastries. Today, the menu has expanded to include a wide variety of drinks,
                                        food items, and merchandise, including seasonal specials and limited-time
                                        offerings.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Digital Presence: In the 90s, Starbucks had a basic website and no social media
                                        presence. Today, Starbucks has a robust online and social media presence, with a
                                        mobile app that allows customers to order and pay for their drinks ahead of
                                        time, earn rewards, and access exclusive offers and promotions.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Sustainability: In the 21st century, Starbucks has made a commitment to
                                        sustainability, with initiatives such as using ethically sourced coffee beans,
                                        reducing waste through recycling and composting, and investing in renewable
                                        energy.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Aforementioned changes came with time but the significant change was it's app. The
                                    Starbucks app was first launched in January 2011 for iPhone users in the United
                                    States. The initial version of the app allowed customers to manage their Starbucks
                                    Rewards account, pay with their mobile device, and locate nearby stores.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since then, the Starbucks app has gone through several updates and enhancements,
                                    adding new features such as the ability to order ahead for pickup, track rewards and
                                    offers, and send gift cards to friends and family. The app has also expanded to
                                    other platforms, including Android and web browsers, and has been launched in
                                    various countries around the world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The launch of the Starbucks app was a significant step for the company in embracing
                                    digital technology and leveraging it to enhance the customer experience. The app has
                                    since become a key part of the Starbucks ecosystem, driving customer engagement and
                                    loyalty while also providing valuable data insights to the company.

                                <p>
                                    The Starbucks app is an excellent example of how a company can use the Hooked Model
                                    to create a habit-forming experience for its users. Here's how the app
                                    uses the four steps of the Hooked Model:
                                </p>
                                <ol style="color: white; font-size: 16px;">
                                    <li>
                                        Trigger: The trigger can be divided for two types of users. New user and an
                                        existing user. Here, we will be talking about existing users.
                                        There are several external triggers that can encourage
                                        existing users of the Starbucks app to continue using it. Some of these
                                        triggers include:
                                        <ul style="color: white; font-size: 16px;">
                                            <li>
                                                Push Notifications: Starbucks can send push notifications to
                                                users with personalized offers, rewards, or reminders to order
                                                ahead.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Seasonal Promotions: Starbucks runs seasonal promotions, such as
                                                holiday drinks or food items, that can encourage users to visit
                                                more often and use the app.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Social Media Advertising: Starbucks advertises promotions and
                                                offers on social media, which can reach existing app users and
                                                encourage them to continue using the app.
                                            </li>
